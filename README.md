# Molla

![Icon](icon.png)

Molla is a launcher for Android, primarily made for use with handheld retro gaming devices that runs Android.

Specifically, Molla is made for use on my ODROID-GO Super. ~~yes i run android on that thing~~ other devices are not tested.

## Some important notes

- Molla is **not** made with performance, stability, long-term maintenance or whatever in mind. Molla is in very early stage of development, highly fragile, crude, and full of bugs. Since I am "if it works it works" kind of guy, those problems probably won't be fixed unless I get the necessity of it.

- Molla is best used on devices with:
  - no touchscreen
  - D-pad always available
  - horizontal screen

- It is **really not recommended** to use Molla on like, usual phones or tablets.

- Android TV is supported, but not tested. Checking "Hide non-TV apps" on settings is recommended if you are using on it.
