# Molla

Molla is a launcher app for Android, intended to be used on handheld retro gaming devices running Android.

## Some important notes

- Molla is **not** made with performance, stability, long-term maintenance in mind. Molla is written very hastily, is highly fragile, crude, and full of bugs. Since I am "if it works it works" kind of guy, those problems probably won't be fixed unless I get the necessity of it.

- Molla is best used on devices with:
  - no touchscreen
  - D-pad always available
  - horizontal screen

- It is **really not recommended** to use Molla on normal devices; e.g. phones or tablets.

- Can be run on Android TV, but is not supported. Enabling "Hide non-TV apps" on settings is recommended if you are using on it.
