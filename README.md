Molla is a launcher app for Android, intended to be used on handheld retro gaming devices running Android.

## About

- Disclaimer: Molla is written very hastily, is highly fragile, crude, and full of bugs. Since I am "if it works it works" kind of guy, those problems probably won't be fixed unless I get the necessity of it.

- Molla is designed to be used on devices with:
  - no touchscreen
  - D-pad controls
  - horizontal screen

- Can be run on regular devices like phones and tablets and such, but is not supported.

- Can be run on Android TV, but is not supported. Enable "Hide non-TV apps" on settings if you are running Molla on Android TV.
